# Headshot Style Transfer

### Introduction
Headshot portraits are commonly taken in professional settings and a lot of time and effort is spent on styling these photographs. This project aims to use a combination of various techniques to style an image taken by anyone using another professionally taken headshot style image. The lighting, retouching effects etc are transferred to the input content image in this method.
